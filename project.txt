# OpenCV Project
## This project uses opencv-python version 4.5.5  Use this link to access the OpenCV-Python tutorials https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html
# __Goals__
## 1. Work through the OpenCV tutorials to learn how the library works, syntax, and strategies
- Complete Introduction, GUI Features, Core Operations, Image Processing, Feature Detection Modules
- Look into Object Detection
- Look into Machine Learning
- Explore Video Analysis
## 2. Find two projects that use OpenCV-Python and compare them. 
- List two things that you learned from each project
- List a critique for each project
## 3. Determine a project that relates to something you encounter every day.
### Examples:
- Develop a vision pipeline that detects a pixel location from this years' FTC challenge
- Develop a program that scans through several images and determines whether your face is in the picture
- Develop a program that can pull a license plate number from pictures of cars
- Develop a program that analyzes drone images to count the number of trees in a picture
